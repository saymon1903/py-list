# Digital Marketing Course Project

This repository contains all the resources, notes, and project work related to the **Digital Marketing** course I completed. The project focuses on applying marketing strategies in real-world scenarios and documenting the experience throughout the journey.

- Social Media Marketing (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)

- Google Ads & SEO
- Influencer Marketing

Each strategy is supported by real-world case studies and practical application through mini-projects included in this repository.

During the course, I worked on several hands-on projects and case studies, which gave me practical experience in:

- Building a brand presence from scratch
- Designing and running ad campaigns
- Analyzing customer behavior and engagement metrics
- Using tools like Google Analytics, Mailchimp, Canva, and Meta Business Suite

I also collaborated with peers and mentors, which improved my teamwork and communication skills in a marketing context.
