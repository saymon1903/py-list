# 🤖 Machine Learning Course Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning learning journey!  
This repository includes all of my notes, practice codes, mini-projects, and my final project for the ML course I completed. It captures both my **technical learning** and **hands-on experience** while working with real-world datasets and algorithms.

## 🧠 What I Learned

During this course, I explored both the **theoretical concepts** and **practical applications** of Machine Learning. Key topics include:

- **Supervised Learning**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)
- **Model Evaluation**
  - Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Cross-Validation
- **Neural Networks (Basic Introduction)**
- **Real-world Project Pipelines**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and engineering

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

I worked extensively with the following tools and Python libraries:

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (ML models)
- TensorFlow / Keras (for basic neural networks)
- Google Colab (cloud-based coding)

## 🧪 My Experience

This course wasn’t just theoretical — I got to **apply what I learned** on real datasets like:

- Housing price prediction
- Customer churn detection
- Iris flower classification
- Movie recommendation system (collaborative filtering)
- Image classification (basic CNN using TensorFlow)

I faced challenges like:

- Overfitting & underfitting models
- Dealing with missing or dirty data
- Choosing the right model for the problem
- Hyperparameter tuning

But I also gained confidence in:

- Structuring an ML pipeline from start to finish
- Interpreting results using visualizations
- Collaborating on GitHub
- Reading and understanding ML research papers (intro level)

## 🚀 Final Capstone Project: Heart Disease Prediction

In the final project, I built a **Heart Disease Prediction Model** using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

**Project Features:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model training and comparison
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and ROC-AUC
- Deployment-ready notebook

📁 Project Location: `./final-project-heart-disease/`
